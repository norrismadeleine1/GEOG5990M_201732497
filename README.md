This project regards improving urban infrastrcuture to promote greener modes of transport with a focus on cycling in Leeds. The outcomes include a time series bar graph that displays the monthly and diurnal trends of cycling rates in West Yorkshire as well as final map displaying the levels of suitable, public cycle parking with recommendations of wards in Leeds that could benefit highly from improvements. 

Studying cycling patterns in Leeds and the availability of cycling infrastructure is crucial for several reasons. One of the main barriers to encouraging more cycling is the perception of safety, comfort, and continuity of the cycling network, particularly among potential or inexperienced cyclists (Hull and O’Holleran, 2014). Addressing connectivity and accessibility issues, especially in congested city centers, through investment in cycling infrastructure is a recommended solution. This includes providing frequent and high-quality bike parking, not just at transport hubs (Hull and O’Holleran, 2014).

Improving cycling infrastructure can significantly enhance cycling safety and increase cycling levels, demonstrating the positive impact of dedicated cycling paths and secure parking facilities (Pucher and Buehler, 2016). Additionally, places with protected cycle paths and secure parking facilities tend to have more balanced gender and age representation among cyclists, indicating that appropriate infrastructure can either deter or encourage cycling (Gössling and McRae, 2022).

The negative impacts of car-based urban mobility, such as local pollution, global warming, resource scarcity, public health issues (e.g., obesity and cardiac diseases), economic costs of traffic congestion, and urban liveability concerns, further highlight the need for promoting cycling (Marqués et al., 2015). Incorporating walking and cycling into daily routines, either as a primary mode of transport or as part of a public transport journey, offers substantial benefits. This approach has been shown to positively impact public health and reduce traffic congestion (Aldred et al., 2019).
